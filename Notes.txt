FOR RENDER TO KEEP IT ACTIVE
By “ping it periodically,” I mean sending a simple request to your backend at regular intervals so that Render doesn’t put it to sleep. Free-tier servers often “sleep” after a period of inactivity (like 15–30 minutes), and the first request after sleep can fail or take a long time while the server boots up. A ping keeps it awake.

How it usually works:

Use a cron job or scheduler – some service or script that runs every few minutes (e.g., every 5–10 minutes).

Send a lightweight request – like a GET /health or GET /ping endpoint on your backend. It shouldn’t do anything heavy; just return a 200 OK.

Backend stays alive – because Render sees activity, it won’t put your server to sleep.

Example: using node-fetch in a simple Node.js script on your computer or another server:

import fetch from "node-fetch";

setInterval(async () => {
  try {
    await fetch("https://studylabz.onrender.com/health");
    console.log("Pinged backend successfully");
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Ping failed:", err.message);
  }
}, 5 * 60 * 1000); // every 5 minutes


Or you can use services like UptimeRobot or Cron-job.org to call your endpoint every 5–10 minutes.

This way, your backend stays “warm,” and your users won’t hit the cold-start 404 problem.
