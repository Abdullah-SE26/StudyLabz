Unable to delete row as it is currently referenced by a foreign key constraint from the table Exam.
Option 1: Cascade delete

Delete all related Exam rows automatically when deleting the Course.

Step 1: Update your Prisma schema:

model Course {
  id         Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name       String  @unique
  code       String  @unique
  description String?
  tags       String[]
  createdById Int
  exams      Exam[]  @relation(onDelete: Cascade) // <-- add cascade delete
}


Step 2: Run:

npx prisma migrate dev --name cascade_course_exam


Now when you delete a course, all related exams are deleted automatically.
